Solution to GoRoot error when running any program written in Go language

This script will create a file named go.sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory and add the necessary variables to this file. In this way, variables are automatically loaded at each logon and Go becomes permanently available.

It uses GO.1.21.3(Latest) Version, you need to update the content when the new version is released.

Good luck to everyone ðŸ¥‡
